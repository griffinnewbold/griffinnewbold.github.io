                      One of the first things I (and in the case of Pong someone else) developed. My first introductory course in high school began by teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the course 
                      curriculum was self-paced with the only deadline being the end of the semester so whenever I had free time I developed these classic games, one of which I used as a project grade
                      for the course. The following games were developed:<br><br>
                      <a href="/party_games/pong.html">1.) Pong</a> <br>
                      <a href="/party_games/memory.html">2.) Memory Game </a> <br>
                      <a href="/party_games/tetris.html">3.) Tetris</a><br><br>
            
                      To my surprise these sites are actually still being hosted even after 6 years. I went and loaded up the sites and transfered the code to their own separate GitHub repos but if you click 
                      on any of the names it will take you to a page to play the game on my site right now! The repos maintain a complete replica of the original code, while these versions are slightly altered 
                      in order to comply with the nature of the site. This means that under the more tab in the top right, "Go Home" takes you back to the landing page of this site while other links do nothing now.

                      After concluding my first year of programming courses in high school, as a young student who absolutely loved to play 
                      video games, I decided to try my hand at making something close to what I liked to spend my free time doing at that time. 
                      I managed to find an old laptop that worked enough and after setting up my programming environment, I got to work using a combination 
                      of youtube tutorials and online articles I managed to get something that was essentially a bare bones game engine. You were able to
                      walk around and interact with the world around you which had a simple texture. The image below is all that remains of this project however. At 
                      the time, I didn't know what Github was and I wasn't smart enough to back up my code, so one day my laptop just crashed and I lost all my work. 
                      This still frame image which came from an old instagram story is the last remanant of that project. After this point I never at least had a recent backup
                      of the code I was working on. <br><br>

                      The syllabus for a course I plan to take in the future, COMS 4160 Computer Graphics, requires the implementation of a 3D game in OpenGL as the 
                      final project, so hopefully within the next year or so I have a more finished product to pay tribute to this project.

                      While I continued programming in my coursework I took a break from personal projects until my AP Calculus BC instructor offered extra credit for some calculus related project.
                      She delightfully accepted this software I had developed as a submission, the main star of the show was the graphing utility that I had developed which allowed a user to graph 
                      two functions on the 2D plane. There was also the additional - but no graphical UI available - functionality from the command line that allowed an individual to calculate the definite 
                      integrals of functions as well. <br><br>

                      The main inspiration for this project came from Desmos which was a popular online graphing calculator that is still available at the proper domain online.

                      Technologies Used: Android Studio and Kotlin<br><br>
            
                      To finish off the high school section of my projects, I took a step outside of my comfort zone and switched up and learned a new language in order to build this app. I also 
                      learned how to use a whole new piece of software as well (Android Studio). In terms of Android development, Kotlin was a much simpler language to work with compared to Java. 
                      The language took my favorite parts of Java and combined it with my favorite aspects of JavaScript which made development easier. I decided to make my final high school project 
                      a mobile app simply because it represented the final territory that I had yet to develop for. I had web-apps, desktop apps, but no mobile apps. At the time I also felt as this 
                      project would aid my college application which were due later that year. Whether not that is true or not is up for debate, but I am very much satisifed with the end result in that 
                      aspect. <br><br>

                      While an app was submitted and published to the Google Play Store, it is not the one you see in the image above, this version has a more refined UI along with a settings 
                      button and functionality. This version never got published to the app store as my senior of high school had begun and I never went through the update process.

                      As part of my Art of Engineering course, I had to make a physical video game as part of a group project. The main deliverable was the black chest box you see in the left side of the image.
                      We were given a $50 budget to work with and had to source all of our electrical and physical components using that money with the exception of the Ardunio board that was used to power the 
                      whole thing. After many brain storming sessions we settled on the design that you see. The team was split into two groups one focused primarily on the software, and another focused primarily 
                      on the hardware. I was in charge of the software team, but I also played a crucial role in putting together the circuitry in the final days. In order to allow the most people to game as possible,
                      I developed a version in Java on my macbook and allowed for more students to play that version if they wanted to. <br><br>

                      I really enjoyed this project in particular because it had both physical as well as digital components, I hope that I will be able to complete another project like this soon!

                      This project was the result of my first hackathon that I participated in. This application was developed by myself and my friend Gabriel, we settled on this topic because 
                      we were currently enrolled in Columbia's Data Structures and Algorithms course and we wanted to develop an application to help visualize and make this process of algorithmic
                      analysis easier. The hackathon began on Friday evening and lasted until Sunday morning. <br><br>

                      The time constraint coupled with the team work needed to make this project work made the whole experience very enjoyable. This would certainly not be the last time I participated 
                      in a hackathon.

                      This project was the final assignment for COMS 3157 Advanced Programming course, the past few assignments leading up to this project were essentially the different components needed, the HTTP client-side,
                      the server-side and the message-lookup service from a database. This final project combined all of this together, along with making it multiprocessed so multiple users could connect and use the service 
                      simultaneously. Since this is an assignment that is reused in other semesters, the repo containing the code for this assignment as well as the others is kept private. Anyone interested in seeing that code

                      This was the project submitted as part of another hackathon hosted by my university. The application was developed once again by myself and my friend Gabriel. I was primarily responsible for the front-end as 
                      well as the backend with the firebase database. After users created accounts with the site, a confirmation email would be sent to the email address they signed up with and then they would be allowed to login. 
                      Once logged in, a user could view the previous dream submissions or write a new one. If they chose to write a new one, their text would be used along with StableDiffusion to generate three images that align 
                      with the text of the image. The GitHub repo has more information as well as a demo present for you to check out if you wish!

                      This project was a solid component of a semester long project for COMS 4111 Introduction to Databases. Google Cloud Services hosted the virtual machines we used to run our web servers off of as well as the
                      postgresql database. This project was developed by me and my teammate Amanda Jenkins. The theme for our project was an education management system, all of our student information is stored and accessed using 
                      a site called SSOL. We effectively wanted to recreate certain aspects of that site along with bringing in different aspects of other services Columbia offers, like the directory. Besides the special admin login
                      people who login to the site are designated by their unis any uni starting with an s denoted a student, i denoted instructors, and a denoted advisors. Each user of a type had a similar but specific dashboard. 
                      Students could add and remove classes as well as change their majors and push changes to their enrollement statistics, instructors could teach new courses, add papers that they had published as well as submit grades 
                      for students enrolled in their courses. Advisors could see their students and update their availability. The Admin is able to add new buildings, people, courses, and departments to the system. Please view the repo on

                      In the Fall 2023, I took a course that focused on functional programming in the Haskell programming language with a emphasis on parallel programming. The course had a final project 
                      that required teams of 2-3 to take an algorithm or process and develop a sequential and a parallel version to show the performance improvements. My team and I developed, using a Python 
                      script as a base, a Haskell version of the Asian Call Option using Monte Carlo simulations. We saw an average of 5x speedup when performing our operations in parallel and using efficient
                      chunking strategies.
