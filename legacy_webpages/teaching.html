          Welcome to my Teaching portfolio, here you can flip through the classes I have TA'ed for in the 
          past. It also contains more information about each class from a TA's perspective, if you wish to see 
          reviews from my times as a TA please click <a href="/resources/reviews.pdf">Here</a> I also do private tutoring, if you wish to receive tutoring 
          please see the contact page in order to learn how to get in contact with me. My rate is 1.5 times the rate which the university pays me as a Teaching Assistant,
          this figure currently sits at $22 per hour meaning the rate for tutoring is $33 per hour. It should be noted that any request for tutoring for a person in a subject
          I am currently a teaching assistant for will be denied.

          Semesters: Spring 2022, Spring 2023, Spring 2024 <br><br> I first started as a Teaching Assistant
          for this course in my second semester of college. After learning the ropes I quickly fell in 
          love with the job and decided to put more effort in future iterations, while that didn't mean I 
          slacked off Spring 2022, it is was simply nothing compared to my efforts in Spring 2023/2024. While I made 
          weekly slide shows to go with my Office Hours in Spring 2022, in Spring 2023/2024, I made weekly lecture notes for the students 
          along with extra supplementary resources and even was given the opportunity to give a lecture during one of
          the class sessions to help the students review for their upcoming midterm exam. <br><br>

          Below is a sample of the extra resources that I provided the students over the Spring 2023 semester
          to view any of these samples please click the corresponding text relating to what document you wish to 
          view. <br><br>

          Whenever I get some free time, I have been working on a proper set of supplementary course notes for the students.
          Drafts of this document have been presented to the students and it seems the demand is there so I will certainly continue
          developing them.

          Semesters: Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 <br><br>

          This course is an introductory programming course designed for non-majors who will most likely program 
          at some point in their college career, whether it is another class or as part of doing research with a professor.
          This course is taught in Python as it is deemed an easy enough language for most people, especially non-majors, to pick up 
          over the course of the semester. <br><br>

          One of the interesting components of this course was that the second half of the course was context specific, when
          students enroll in the course they select one of the following contexts: Economics, Social Science, Biology, Art, and Linguistics.
          The homework assignments for the second half focused heavily on these contexts, I was a TA for the Economics context and students were
          exposed to basic rules of probability and learned the basics of monte-carlo method of approximation as well as the law of large numbers. 
          <br><br>

          Students also had to attend weekly lab sessions held by a TA which briefly reviewed material from lecture and then allowed 
          the students to get more ungraded practice with the concepts in order to help them succeed on their homework assignments.
          <br><br>

          Below are a set of course notes that I developed during the summer prior to Fall 2023 that cover all of the general Python 
          students are expected to know and some more. <br><br>

          Semester: Fall 2024 <br><br>

          After completing the course myself the previous Fall, I decided that as a senior I should expand out and try new classes 
          to TA for that were more in line with my talents and skill set. This is an core-elective course that juniors, seniors and even 
          graduate students can take to fulfill some of their degree requirements. <br><br>

          Central to the course is a large technical project completed in groups of 4 to 5 students, with each TA acting as a mentor for
          around 3 to 4 groups. The TA is responsible for making sure the students understand the requirements of each project iteration as well 
          as demoing the students projects at the appropriate time throughout the semester. TAs are also responsible for grading the 
          individual assessments of their mentees as the assessments are strongly connected to the team projects. <br><br>

          I was also given the opportunity to develop a series of individual assignments to act as a mini project for the first month of 
          the course, more information about this will become available in the projects section as I develop it over the coming months.
