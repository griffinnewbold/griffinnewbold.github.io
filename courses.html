      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class = "section-text">Welcome to my Homepage! 
        I am currently a third year undergraduate student at Columbia University
        studying Computer Science. This site will serve as my expanded personal portfolio.
        This will allow me to showcase more about myself than my resume or my github page ever
        could alone. While my Github profile showcases all my technical projects, my resume only 
        shows the effective highlights. There is so much more beyond either of those that this page
        felt necessary. Plus it helps demonstrate the existence of front-end development skills on my part,
        even though I do not specialize in such areas. <br><br>
        
        This upcoming semester, I will continue my Computer Science education at Columbia. Last semester 
        I finished up the core requirements for my major so all I am left with are electives. While the core of 
        the major had a good mix of theorectical courses along with applications based ones, I intend to take courses
        that focus more on applications than the theory. While you can find more information about the courses, I have taken/plan to take 
        in the "Courses Taken" section I will layout the courses I plan to take in the upcoming term related to my field of study. <br>

        <ul>
          <li class="course-item">COMS 4156 Advanced Software Engineering</li>
          <li class="course-item">COMS 3410 Computers and Society</li>
          <li class="course-item">COMS 3107 Clean Object Oriented Design</li>
          <li class="course-item">COMS 4170/4995 User Interface Design OR Parallel Functional Programming</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class = "section-text">
        The last course is dependent on whether or not I get off the waitlist for 4170, if I do it will be that course
        otherwise it will be the 4995 course specified. Next I will discuss my coding background and essentially how I got to 
        this point in my Software Developing Journey.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class = "section-text">
        I started my programming journey in my first year of highschool, I took AP Computer Science Principles which was a newly offered course
        at my highschool. My instructor choose JavaScript for the first half of the course then began teaching us Java in the second half of the course.
        I continued down the Java rabbit hole and took AP Computer Science A in my second year followed by the two Java courses offered by my local community college
        through their dual enrollment program. After I completed these courses, I successfully completed my OCA Java 8 SE Programmer I exam offered by Oracle. At this point I took a few other courses through my community college which introduced 
        me to C++ as well as MySQL and Visual Basic, along with some basic IT trouble shooting skills through their Operating Systems course. I concluded my high school journey by taking a Networking course 
        which used coursework and a curriculum developed by Cisco. <br><br>

        Once I arrived on Columbia's campus, I began their Computer Science curriculum right away, concurrently taking COMS 1004 and ENGL 1006 in my first semester
        and finishing the academic year with the completion of their Data Structures and Algorithms course.
        My second year began with a deeper dive into Columbia's Computer Science curriculum, I took Discrete Mathematics, Advanced Programming, Fundamentals of Computer Systems, and Probability for Engineers* 
        This past semester I finished up the core of my major by completing Computer Science Theory and Computational Linear Algebra. I also began to explore the high level elective courses through my Introduction to Databases 
        course. As stated previously more information about these courses can be found in the appropriate section of the site. <br><br>
        
        Of course while I took these courses, I also completed many personal projects and contributed to the learning community as well. More information about all of these can 
        be found in the "Teaching" and "Projects" sections! Thanks for stopping by to read, I hope you take more time to explore my site. If for whatever reason you wish
        to contact me please see the "Contact Me" section for more information about that, if you wish to connect with me on LinkedIn please see the appropriately named section.
