            I am more than just someone who is always hitting the books. Throughout my days in high school and college I was involved to a reasonable degree. I was never a person who 
            did something because it looked good, but rather because I had a genuine interest in those activities. Here is a compilation of the groups I have been a part of during my 
            time in college and high school, for relevancy reasons, I will start with college.
        </p>
        <h2>College Extracurriculars</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            1. CodePrentice <br>
            CodePrentice was an organization that I was a member of during my first academic year at Columbia. It was a team focused on making connecting students to open sources projects.
            Along with maintaining their own website and related services. I was brought aboard as a front-end developer, which I was perfectly fine with at the time but what I really wanted was 
            to be a middle end or back end developer as those were my interests at the time and still now as well. The more experienced members of the group taught me about Git as well as React and 
            TypeScript so my brief time with this group was not fruitless. <br><br>

            2. Columbia ADI <br>
            ADI is the largest technology focused club on campus. Members are offered many opportunities throughout the academic year ranging from workshops to teach new skills to talks with 
            local workers in the Tech Industry to describe their experiences. The hackathons that I have previously mentioned are hosted by ADI, which is another cool thing about the group. While
            my involvement with the group has been rather limited in the past I hope to take more advantage of the opportunities they provide in the coming semesters. 
        </p>


        <h2>High School Extracurriculars</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            1. Computer Science Club <br>
            This club was the result of my own petitioning and planning. After numerous talks with my high school's administration and members of the 
            faculty, I managed to bring this club into existence. At our biweekly meetings we would discuss new trends in technology as well as explore 
            different programming languages. It was a completely beginner friendly club and any necessary programming skills were taught through fun little exercises.<br><br>

            2. The Quizbowl Team<br>
            When I was in high school I felt as if my brain simply had no bounds, this was my way to express that. Pretty much your standard quiz bowl, there were group rounds and solo 
            rounds. I was always proficient in mathematics, computer science, and western civilization type questions. I participated in 3 out of my 4 years of high school, and was team 
            captain for the last year.
