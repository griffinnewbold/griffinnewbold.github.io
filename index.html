                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class = "section-text">Welcome to my Homepage! 
                    I am currently a third year undergraduate student at Columbia University
                    studying Computer Science. This site will serve as my expanded personal portfolio.
                    This will allow me to showcase more about myself than my resume or my github page ever
                    could alone. While my Github profile showcases all my technical projects, my resume only 
                    shows the effective highlights. There is so much more beyond either of those that this page
                    felt necessary. Plus it helps demonstrate the existence of front-end development skills on my part,
                    even though I do not specialize in such areas. <br><br>
                    
                    This upcoming semester, I will continue my Computer Science education at Columbia. Two semesters ago 
                    I finished up the core requirements for my major so all I am left with are electives. While the core of 
                    the major had a good mix of theorectical courses along with applications based ones, I intend to take courses
                    that focus more on applications than the theory. While you can find more information about the courses, I have taken/plan to take 
                    in the "Courses Taken" section I will layout the courses I plan to take in the upcoming term related to my field of study. <br>

                    <ul>

                    As of the beginning of the Spring Semester the above is the planned selection of Computer Science courses I plan to take.

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p class = "section-text">
                    I started my programming journey in my first year of highschool, I took AP Computer Science Principles which was a newly offered course
                    at my highschool. My instructor choose JavaScript for the first half of the course then began teaching us Java in the second half of the course.
                    I continued down the Java rabbit hole and took AP Computer Science A in my second year followed by the two Java courses offered by my local community college
                    through their dual enrollment program. After I completed these courses, I successfully completed my OCA Java 8 SE Programmer I exam offered by Oracle. At this point I took a few other courses through my community college which introduced 
                    me to C++ as well as MySQL and Visual Basic, along with some basic IT trouble shooting skills through their Operating Systems course. I concluded my high school journey by taking a Networking course 
                    which used coursework and a curriculum developed by Cisco. <br><br>

                    Once I arrived on Columbia's campus, I began their Computer Science curriculum right away, concurrently taking COMS 1004 and ENGL 1006 in my first semester
                    and finishing the academic year with the completion of their Data Structures and Algorithms course. My second year saw me take a deeper dive into the Computer 
                    Science curriculum that Columbia had to offer taking classes like Discrete Mathematics and Advanced Programming. My last two years at Columbia have allowed me 
                    to take elective courses that I found interesting and involved skills that I wanted to learn. <br><br>
                    
                    Of course while I took these courses, I also completed many personal projects and contributed to the learning community as well. More information about all of these can 
                    be found in the "Teaching" and "Projects" sections! Thanks for stopping by to read, I hope you take more time to explore my site. If for whatever reason you wish
                    to contact me please see the "Contact Me" section for more information about that, if you wish to connect with me on LinkedIn please see the appropriately named section.
