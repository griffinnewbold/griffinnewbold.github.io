                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class = "section-text">Welcome to my Homepage! 
                    I am currently a recent graduate from Columbia University's School of Engineering. This website serves
                    as my expanded personal portfolio. My GitHub only showcases technical projects and my resume only offers
                    highlights, there is so much more beyond either of those. This website is the result of attempting to fill
                    the void and expand more upon things concerned with me. Plus it helps demonstrate the existence of front-end development skills on my part,
                    even though I do not specialize in such areas. <br><br>
                    
                    This past semester (Spring 2025) I wrapped up my Columbia education with a healthy mix of technical classes as well as liberal arts classes. 
                    I also began working on research/startup work that will be discussed more in the projects section. I graduated in May 2025 with a Bachelor's of
                    Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Applications. My cumulative GPA was a 3.83 and my major GPA was a 3.94. <br><br>

                    Throughout the summer I will move into my new apartment in the DMV area and begin my new job as a Software Engineer at Capital One in the 
                    middle of August, I am excited for the work I will be doing there and just excited for what the future has in store as well. <br><br>
                
                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p class = "section-text">
                    I started my programming journey in my first year of highschool, I took AP Computer Science Principles which was a newly offered course
                    at my highschool. My instructor choose JavaScript for the first half of the course then began teaching us Java in the second half of the course.
                    I continued down the Java rabbit hole and took AP Computer Science A in my second year followed by the two Java courses offered by my local community college
                    through their dual enrollment program. After I completed these courses, I successfully completed my OCA Java 8 SE Programmer I exam offered by Oracle. At this point I took a few other courses through my community college which introduced 
                    me to C++ as well as MySQL and Visual Basic, along with some basic IT trouble shooting skills through their Operating Systems course. I concluded my high school journey by taking a Networking course 
                    which used coursework and a curriculum developed by Cisco. <br><br>

                    Once I arrived on Columbia's campus, I began their Computer Science curriculum right away, concurrently taking COMS 1004 and ENGL 1006 in my first semester
                    and finishing the academic year with the completion of their Data Structures and Algorithms course. My second year saw me take a deeper dive into the Computer 
                    Science curriculum that Columbia had to offer taking classes like Discrete Mathematics and Advanced Programming. My last two years at Columbia have allowed me 
                    to take elective courses that I found interesting and involved skills that I wanted to learn. <br><br>
                    
                    Of course while I took these courses, I also completed many personal projects and contributed to the learning community as well. More information about all of these can 
                    be found in the "Teaching" and "Projects" sections! Thanks for stopping by to read, I hope you take more time to explore my site. If for whatever reason you wish
                    to contact me please see the "Contact Me" section for more information about that, if you wish to connect with me on LinkedIn please see the appropriately named section.
