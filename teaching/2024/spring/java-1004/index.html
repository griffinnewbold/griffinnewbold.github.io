      <h1>COMS W1004: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java</h1>
      <p class = "section-text">
        From the directory of courses: "A general introduction to computer science for science and engineering students interested 
        in majoring in computer science or engineering. Covers fundamental concepts of computer science, algorithmic problem-solving
        capabilities, and introductory Java programming skills" 
      </p>  
      <p class = "section-text">
        The course is exactly as described above and more. While enrolled you will learn how to program in the Java programming 
        language but I hope that is not all you will learn from this course. Computer Science opens your mind to a different way
        of thinking and I hope you learn to utlitize this new way of thinking and bring it with you going forward.
      </p>
      <p class = "section-text">
        Going forward it is important to understand that this website, for the most part, has been constructed solely for fun and
        you <b>SHOULD NOT</b> use this site as a substitute for courseworks, doing so will not end well for you most likely and I assume 
        no responsibility for the choices you make moving forward.

        That being said, this site will be used to host any resources developed by myself. When I first started doing this job for 
        Professor Cannon all of my resources lived solely on courseworks. After the second iteration of the course, I made a GitHub
        repository to store all the resources and pointed everyone to that. The problem with that is a lot of people do not totally
        understand how to navigate a repository, so this site is the abstraction that resulted from that. 
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        The attached notes in the schedule below are based off the Spring 2023 lectures, so there may be some extra content that is not necessary or 
        some information may be missing. It is YOUR job to determine this information for yourself, these notes are <b>NOT</b> a substitute for going to 
        lecture. That being said, students have always found an alternative explanation helpful. It is also important to note all resources hosted 
        are the originals made by me, there may be some files on courseworks that have made some modifications from the originals, I believe in the 
        originals so they shall stay as such.
