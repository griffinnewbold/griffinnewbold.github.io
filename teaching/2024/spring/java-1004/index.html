      <h1>COMS W1004: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java</h1>
      <p class = "section-text">
        From the directory of courses: "A general introduction to computer science for science and engineering students interested 
        in majoring in computer science or engineering. Covers fundamental concepts of computer science, algorithmic problem-solving
        capabilities, and introductory Java programming skills" 
      </p>  
      <p class = "section-text">
        The course is exactly as described above and more. While enrolled you will learn how to program in the Java programming 
        language but I hope that is not all you will learn from this course. Computer Science opens your mind to a different way
        of thinking and I hope you learn to utlitize this new way of thinking and bring it with you going forward.
      </p>
      <p class = "section-text">
        Going forward it is important to understand that this website, for the most part, has been constructed solely for fun and
        you should not use this site as a substitute for courseworks, doing so will not end well for you most likely and I assume 
        no responsibility for the choices you make moving forward.

        That being said, this site will be used to host any resources developed by myself. When I first started doing this job for 
        Professor Cannon all of my resources lived solely on courseworks. After the second iteration of the course, I made a GitHub
        repository to store all the resources and pointed everyone to that. The problem with that is a lot of people do not totally
        understand how to navigate a repository, so this site is the abstraction that resulted from that. 
      </p>
      <p class = "section-text">
        The schedule below is based off of the Spring 2023 version of the course which was when I developed the most recent version
        of my materials that I provide to students. This was done after a recent overhaul of course content so the content should be
        mostly accurate, if something is covered during the semester that has been omitted from previous semesters I will update the
        page to reflect that. I am doubtful that the ordering of the content will change in a significant way but I will double check
        this information when the updated syllabus becomes available. 
      </p>
      <p class = "section-text">
        The last thing I will mention is how to navigate this site, the header bar contains different relevant sections of the course's
        site as well as my overarching site, clicking my name will take you to the homepage of my site. If you click teaching you will
        be taken to a part of my personal site related to my different teaching experiences. The other sections relate to important
        components in the course, all of which are self explanatory in what they contain. Happy Hacking and good luck in 1004!
