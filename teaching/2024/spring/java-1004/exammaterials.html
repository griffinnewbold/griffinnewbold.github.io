            A solid percentage of your grade will be based on the completion of three exams, two midterms and a cumulative final exam. 
            The midterms will be identical in format with the final being formatted differently. Clicking through will provide some 
            details about what the format of the exam will be (approximately) and some resources to help you prepare.

            The first midterm has approximately 25-30 multiple choice questions on it, the questions will be based off the material presented.
            Any material mentioned either directly in lecture, or through sources mentioned in lecture are considered fair game. The following are
            resources that I have made in the past to assist you in your preparation. <br><br>

            The professor may also provide some more practice questions but it is not guaranteed and should not be expected.

              The final exam has 3 sections on it, a standard multiple choice section that you should be used to, a short answer section, and a longer 
              free response section where you'll be expected to write code, as a reminder this will all be done via pencil and paper. I have made a full 
              length practice final exam which students have found extremely helpful and accurate in the past. <br><br>
