        <h1>Course Policies Overview</h1>
        <p class = "section-text">
            There are several different policies that you should be aware of throughout the duration of the course. These are 
            subject to change, and if there is a conflict between what is stated below and what is stated on courseworks or the
            professor, then it is better to trust the professor and courseworks instead.
        </p>
        <h2>Academic Honesty Policy</h2>
        <p class = "section-text">
            You are expected to submit work that is solely your own, that being said, you are free to collaborate and use 
            resources like google and stackoverflow, if you do anything that is not your own work, please cite your source 
            in the README.txt that you submit, or if it is a written assignment either inline or at the bottom. 
        </p>
        <h2>Regrade Policy</h2>
        <p class = "section-text">
            Assignments you submit are generally returned to you in 1-2 weeks following the passage of the late deadline. Once an
            assignment has been returned the regrade period will open after 24 hours and will last for a week. It can take an extremely
            long time for a regrade to be resolved in the event it is warranted, all regrades will be resolved prior to the end of the 
            semester. If you have an issue with *how* many points were taken off, that is not an issue the TAs deal with and if you'd like 
            to question the point allocations of the homeworks, you are more than welcome to email the professor. When reviewing the grades
            via gradescope all item boxes will be shown. ONLY BOXES WITH A CHECKMARK NEXT TO THEM have been applied to your submission. That
            being said, use the presented rubric to see if any points were taken off but you believe they shouldn't have been, it is very possible
            for a TA to make a mistake while grading. Be polite when submitting requests and provide enough detail to make our jobs easier. TAs have 
            the final say so if a TA says you do not get points back do not submit additional requests attempting to fight it. Grading is anonymous from 
            both ends, we do not know who we are grading and you do not know who is grading you, this way all grading remains as objective as possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Late Submissions Policy</h2>
        <p class = "section-text">
            You are provided a set amount of late days to use over the course of the semester, it is usually 9 days, these can/should be 
            used for emergencies or other things like religious observances. You can use 7 of these days per assignment but any amount of
            a day constitutes a single late day, i.e. 12:01am means 1 late day is gone. You are expected to keep track of how many late days 
            you use and try not to run out as work submitted late without proper allocation of late days remaining generally isn't accepted. 
            That being said, it is very much still in your best interest to submit all assignments including late ones. 
        </p>
        <h2>Exam Policy</h2>
        <p class = "section-text">
            All exams are closed book, closed internet, no calculator, etc unless otherwise stated. Those with the proper disability
            accommodations will take in person exams where they normally take their exams and will have the proper extensions and/or 
            other resources applied there. For all others who take exams within the classroom, for the midterms you will be expected 
            to complete the exam within the class time (75 minutes). The final exam is a 3 hour comprehensive exam that is held during 
            finals week. If you believe there is a conflict with the exam for whatever reason please email Professor Cannon as soon as possible. 
            If you can email him prior to the incident occurring please do so in order to arrange a potential make up. For those who do not
            complete the exams during the times they are offered and has no makeup arranged will receive a grade of 0.   
        </p>
        <h2>Final Grade Policy</h2>
        <p class = "section-text">
            This class is curved. I repeat the class is curved, it has always been curved and I do not see any reason for this 
            changing anytime soon. The curve is set at a B/B+ average. Students who enroll in the course but submit nothing will 
            receive a UW in the course. You are typically provided the median/average score when assignments/exams are returned to 
            you. This course, despite being an introductory 1000 level course, is not easy for most people that take it. If you are 
            expecting an easy A, assuming you have no prior experience then don't count on it. Getting an A is very much possible and 
            certainly a rewarding experience.
