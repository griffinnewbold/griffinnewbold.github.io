        <h1>Office Hours Overview</h1>
        <p class = "section-text">
            All teaching assistants are required to hold office hours weekly until the last day of courses. Trivially, I am no
            exception to this rule. It is vital to know that I am also an undergraduate student like yourselves, meaning I am 
            enrolled in plenty of courses during the semester and so my time is limited. I try my best to make time to be readily
            available to students. Assuming I get the schedule I want, I will ideally hold my office hours from 2:40-3:40pm on Tuesdays
            and Thursdays. This is right after the second section of the course, my office hours will normally be held on the Third Floor
            of Mudd but for the first bit, especially during shopping period I will be holding my office hours virtually. Please refer 
            to the Google Calendar on courseworks for exact details.
        </p>
        <p class = "section-text">
            Traditionally, my office hours have tended to be some of the more packed ones among the teaching staff, however several
            factors influence how busy office hours are. Firstly is when I hold my office hours, picking a time in the middle of the 
            day can be both good or bad depending on how everyone else's schedules are. Another factor would be how close we are to a 
            homework deadline. I am anticipating Professor Cannon to make homeworks due on the Sunday/Monday prior to lectures for the
            given week. This would mean that Thursdays may be busier than Tuesdays. 
        </p>
        <h1>Tips for Office Hours</h1>
        <p class = "section-text">
            I would consider myself relatively forgiving and kind when it comes to office hours, this is especially true in the 
            first half of the course. Just like the course, my expectations for what you should be able to do on your own grow as 
            the semester progresses. Since the course does get harder as time moves forward, chances are the questions you have will
            become more complex and will require more of my time. In order to maximize my effectiveness and minimize the time you spend 
            waiting to receive assistance be sure to follow these tips prior to and during office hours. 
        </p>
        <h3>1. Be Familiar With Lecture Material</h3>
        <p class = "section-text">
            This does not mean you need to have completely understood what was shown in lecture, but you should be able to recall
            the concept itself if I asked. For example assuming you had covered Binary Search, you should be prepared to answer 
            "What is Binary Search?" need not worry about questions like "How can we prove the complexity of Binary Search?". 
            Assuming you missed lecture, then I would advise skimming the lecture notes I post on the homepage where the schedule is.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Arrive as Early as Possible to Office Hours</h3>
        <p class ="section-text">
            Like most people, I am most understanding, patient, and useful towards the beginning of office hours so if you know 
            you need assistance and are able to, the early bird gets the worm. 
        </p>
        <h3>3. Do not Expect the Teaching Staff to Write your Code for You</h3>
        <p class ="section-text">
            Generally, it is bad practice for any member to touch and write code on your machine. The main exception being that there 
            is an extensive, nontrivial bug that requires relatively focused debugging. Along with this, you shouldn't go to office hours 
            expecting solutions to the problem sets. The expectation from office hours is that you better understand the concepts necessary 
            to complete the homework rather than the specifics needed solely for that particular homework. 
        </p>
        <h3>4. Collaborate with your Classmates</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
            You are encourage to talk to those next to you to help each other out, iron sharpens iron. The person next to you
            might have the answer to whatever you are stuck on so it never hurts to ask. If you are curious about what boundaries
            exist when it comes to academic honesty, please review the course policies page for more. 
        </p>
        <h3>5. Make Use of ED Discussion</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
            If you have a question that does not require extensive debugging and is more related to course material and 
            course logistics, please make a public post on the discussion platform accessible via courseworks, you have 
            the option to make your post anonymous if you do not wish for your name to be made public as well.
