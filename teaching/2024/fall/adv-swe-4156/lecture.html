          From the directory of courses: "A general introduction to computer science for science and engineering
          students interested
          in majoring in computer science or engineering. Covers fundamental concepts of computer science, algorithmic
          problem-solving
          capabilities, and introductory Java programming skills"
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          The course is exactly as described above and more. While enrolled you will learn how to program in the Java
          programming
          language but I hope that is not all you will learn from this course. Computer Science opens your mind to a
          different way
          of thinking and I hope you learn to utlitize this new way of thinking and bring it with you going forward.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Going forward it is important to understand that this website, for the most part, has been constructed solely
          for fun and
          you <b>SHOULD NOT</b> use this site as a substitute for courseworks, doing so will not end well for you most
          likely and I assume
          no responsibility for the choices you make moving forward.

          That being said, this site will be used to host any resources developed by myself. When I first started doing
          this job for
          Professor Cannon all of my resources lived solely on courseworks. After the second iteration of the course, I
          made a GitHub
          repository to store all the resources and pointed everyone to that. The problem with that is a lot of people
          do not totally
          understand how to navigate a repository, so this site is the abstraction that resulted from that.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          The attached notes in the schedule below are based off the Spring 2023 lectures, so there may be some extra
          content that is not necessary or
          some information may be missing. It is YOUR job to determine this information for yourself, these notes are
          <b>NOT</b> a substitute for going to
          lecture. That being said, students have always found an alternative explanation helpful. It is also important
          to note all resources hosted
          are the originals made by me, there may be some files on courseworks that have made some modifications from
          the originals, I believe in the
          originals so they shall stay as such.
