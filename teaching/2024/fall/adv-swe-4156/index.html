          This is a course which teaches practices and techniques related to Software Engineering. The course title
          is a bit of a misnomer as back when this course was made there was also a 3156 which was introduction to software 
          engineering, but that course was replaced with 3157 which you all know as Advanced Programming.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          While the content that goes along with this course is very important and informative, the team project is really
          where most of the learning and development for this course comes from. Not only will you learn to work with a sizeable
          team, but you'll also potentially learn about new technologies as well. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Below is a tenative schedule to follow with important deadlines/due dates for the semester it is important to pay attention
          to these, if there is any discrepancy between these and courseworks it is best to trust courseworks.
