        If you reached this page then you are probably curious on how to contact me! Well there are different
        preferred ways depending on who you are so please find the section header below that best describes you
      </p>
      <h2>Columbia Affiliates</h2>
      <p class = "section-text">
        In order to best get into contact with me, please use my .edu address so I may see your message as soon as possible. 
        Send an email to gcn2106@columbia.edu and please state your business briefly in the subject line and then write the rest 
        of your message as you probably normally would. During the academic year I will most likely respond within a day or two, if this
        has not happened feel free to send a follow up! If we are outside the academic year then it could take at most 7 business days.
      </p>
      <h2>Recruiters/Workplace Officials</h2>
      <p class = "section-text">
        Greetings to any recruiters or other workplace officials who happened to stumble upon my page. If you have not already reached out to
        me then please use my LinkedIn for any communications, simply click the LinkedIn title above and you will be taken to my LinkedIn 
        page, there you can send me a message and/or connect with me. I will respond to your message as soon as I am able to.
      </p>
      <h2>Other University Affiliates</h2>
      <p class = "section-text">
        If you happen to be an affilate of another accredited university, student or otherwise, please first send me a connection request on linkedin
        and then follow that up with an email to my .edu account as described under the "Columbia Affiliates" section above, depending on whether not 
        I have previously interacted with you will most likely dictate response times, I will try to respond in the same time period as described above. 
      </p>
      <h2>Anyone Else</h2>
      <p class = "section-text">
        If you do not fall into the previously mentioned categories then please reconsider sending me a message, if we have a previously established personal
        connection then chances are you already are in possession of a way to contact me, I suggest you use that method. For all others, please refrain from 
        contacting me unless it is an emergency, in which case please reach out via LinkedIn.
