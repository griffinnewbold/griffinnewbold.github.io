      <h1>What is Contemporary Civilizations</h1> <br>
      <p>Contemporary Civilizations is a year long seminar based course offered by Columbia University. It was first
        introduced after the first World War to introduce problems
        of the present day to students. Over the course of this year, students read several texts written by famous
        and/or influential philsophers that hold several diverse
        opinions on a variety of different subjects like morality. The idea is that students, after being exposed to
        these texts, have a deeper understanding of the world around
        them from a political/social/moral and religious perspective. This enables them to make well thought out
        decisions about the beliefs they hold and to contribute to the world
        for the better. More information on this course can be found <a
          href="https://www.college.columbia.edu/core-curriculum/classes/contemporary-civilization">at this link</a> The
        course is required for all Columbia College students and serves as a potential options for Columbia Engineering
        students looking to fulfill their liberal arts requirements.

      <h1>Purpose of this Website</h1>
      <p>As part of my section of Contemporary Civilizations course, we had to complete a final project. I wanted to
        take this as an opportunity to combine the humanities with my
        STEM background and as a result this website exists as a medium for my final project.

      <h1>Why These Authors?</h1>
      <p>The authors covered on this website are all the main authors that each CC section covers, these authors were
        chosen due to their vast contributions to their particular
        field, whether it is economics, politics, or general philsophy. Instructors are also encouraged to include
        additional texts to add some flavor to the CC syllabus, for sake
        of brevity those authors and works are omitted unless tied specifically to an author who is already being
        discussed (Adam Smith for example also wrote a work titled: "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" which was read
        within my section)
        The syllabus goes under review every now and again to make revisions but the syllabus is reasonably stable. This
        site focuses specifically on the works and authors of the second semester of CC.

    <div class="row">
      <h1>Why These Works?</h1>
      <p>Just like their respective authors these works represent a vast array of different ideas and viewpoints across
        a variety of subjects, these works were selected and placed on the main CC syllabus
        as it was determined that they did a good job of making their ideas clear and/or were representative of a
        particular fragment of time influenced by current events. This site focuses specifically
        on the works and authors of the second semester of CC.
