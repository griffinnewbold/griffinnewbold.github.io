      <h5>Preface & Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        Following the first day of our candidate forum between Mill, Marx and Freud, I had frustration that I needed to
        get out, an hour later the following
        text was complete as it is displayed, any revisions that were made were grammatical.
      </p>

    <div class="row">
      <h5>Text</h5>
      <p>
        The core of Mill’s ideas centers on the individual and the individual’s significance in societal direction. Mill
        offers a perfect and idealized balance between what the individual wants and what the individual can perform in
        society. Under a Mill framework, the liberty of the individual shall not be constrained by any dominant power so
        long as the individual does not harm any single individual or group with his actions. The goal of the individual
        is to promote social and individual well being by performing actions that do not contribute negatively to the
        overall utility of society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restricting the individual in unnecessary ways will in the long term restrict society from progressing and
        improving. If individual discourse is not permitted, if the individual is not provided autonomy in decisions
        that are pertinent to the individual then how can a society truly possess these same powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sigmund Freud attempted to describe the discontent of those living in society and pinned the blame on the
        societal norms restricting the individual from progressing towards their desires and suggested removing the
        limitations on “love objects” that humanity should be able to have. This in some instances can be okay and
        beneficial for society as in the case of bisexuality and homosexuality, as mental issues see a decrease within
        these respective groups when these actions are made legal. The main issue arises when incestual relationships
        are being pursued Charles Darwin famously made note of issues that can potentially arise as a result of
        inbreeding, with the issues only getting worse with each future generation. It is not in the best interest of
        humanity for all restraints to be loosened as this will result in both societal agony as well as future
        individual suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Karl Marx’s critiques of capitalism are not baseless, however, to suggest the collectivisation of all property
        and means of production is simply out of the question. As described by Freud, humanity has been endowed with
        natural instincts and those instincts cannot be denied forever without consequences that damage the psyche and
        by extension society. So how would Marxist ideas of collectivism work in such a way? Do Marxists believe they
        can best human nature? I doubt it. Mill argues that work that can be done by the private sector should be done
        by the private sector while Marxists believe all of this is better left to the state. Some of those representing
        Marxist ideals state that even when governments in individualistic societies perform actions it is actual
        private entities buying power and taking control of the back seat, while I disagree with this being the case,
        let’s roll with it for now. Assuming this is the case then while the state has never done anything wrong it also
        has no holding for the good done in the name of government like: child labor laws, environmental regulations, or
        employee protections that fight back against some of the very critiques that Marx throws at capitalism’s path.
        Marx centers his discussion on class struggle and how those class struggles have persisted and just changed form
        throughout the history of the world and under capitalism it is the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Social
        hierarchies were a lot more rigid back in the days of feudal society or the Roman empire, individuals are able
        to move between social classes with enough time and dedication to that end. Only after pro market reforms in the
        1980s and 1990s did the claimed communist chinese society begin to see the rate of people living in extreme
        poverty (as defined by the world bank) decrease substantially and it was only after China allowed individuals to
        effectively own real estate did the GDP per capita of China skyrocket from $2694 in 2007 to $12720 in 2022. The
        effective application of Marxist ideas in governments around the world has resulted in nothing but restrained
        liberty with poor economic conditions. All the self proclaimed communist regimes that have existed are a
        culmination of Marxist idealism combined with Freudian psychoanalysis and a rejection of Millian ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The free flow of ideas, the unrestrained individual - with exceptions abiding to the harm principle - is the
        only way that society has progressed. All of this is independent of capitalism which only served as a means for
        expediting the decay of the old regimes in light of the new. A society filled with ambitious individuals willing
        to do whatever it takes to make progress is the best condition of a society. The division of labor and
        specialization allow people to do what they do best in a way that is contributing to some aspect of society. It
        is because of specialization and this division of labor that Marx was able to write at all; the same can be said
        with Freud.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic unit of civilization is the individual, this cannot be forgotten. Prioritizing the liberty and utility
        of the
        individual will be more beneficial to society than to its detriment.
