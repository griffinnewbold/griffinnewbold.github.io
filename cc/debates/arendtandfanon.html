      <h5>Preface & Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        On April 30th 2024, a standoff began between protestors occupying Hamilton hall and the Columbia administration
        which ultimately led to the NYPD being authorized to enter campus to clear them out. This is a day in which time
        seemingly stood frozen with everyone waiting in anticipation for the newest email, the newest report from the
        local radio station, for something to happen. Everyone knew what needed to happen but no one wanted it to
        happen, everyone wanted conflict to be avoided, this was not the case. At around the 9:30 mark, the dam burst
        and the police entered campus through multiple different entrances, leading to conflict with the protestors in
        front of Hamilton hall and causing pandemonium among bystanders who wanted to be witness to the seemingly
        generational event. The aftershocks of this event are still being felt and some are saying the community will
        never heal. Many wonder about what to do next as they feel empty. I share those sentiments and I am also
        reminded of the ideas of Hannah Arendt and Frantz Fanon who spoke on the topic of power and violence.

      <h2>Text</h2>
      <p>Violence is a term that can mean many different things depending on who you ask. For some an action is not
        considered violent until there is an unnecessarily forceful action in occurrence. For others, violence occurs
        the moment you make physical contact. A quick search on the internet today defines violence as “the use of
        physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy” (Merriam-Webster). This definition excludes the use
        of rhetoric, does that mean speech cannot be violent? Point is that defining violence is hard, it is even harder
        to properly understand violence. Hannah Arendt and Frantz Fanon are two philosophers who attempted to define and
        understand violence and ultimately came to two very different conclusions. These opposing conclusions really
        just confirm what I have already stated: violence is complex. Fanon’s <i>Wretched of the Earth</i> and Arendt’s
        <i>On
          Violence</i> were written in 1961 and 1972 respectively. It has been over 50 years since the latter of these
        two
        works was published, do their ideas hold any weight in today’s world? I believe that the answer to this question
        is yes.</p>
      <p>Fanon wrote his Wretched of the Earth after bearing witness to French colonial efforts in Algeria. His
        discussion focused solely on the viewpoint of those who were being colonized, describing the distinction between
        areas in which the colonizers lived and those of the colonized. The swelling disdain, anger, and hatred that
        would boil up inside the minds and hearts of those who lived every day under the heel of an oppressive regime
        would ultimately lead to violence. A natural feeling resulting from all of the injustice done upon the native
        inhabitants of the region, but what purpose would it serve? Fanon discusses the prerequisites leading up to this
        first violent act and how the character of the oppressed had evolved over the course of the oppression which
        leads to him concluding that “Violence is a cleansing force. It frees the native from his inferiority complex
        and from his despair and inaction; it makes him fearless and restores his self-respect” (<i>Wretched of the
          Earth</i>,
        Fanon). In effect, violence is a call to action for all those who can relate to the cause to come and join for
        the time is now or never. Fanon posits violence as a prerequisite to freedom and perhaps it is, but there have
        been times in history in which violence was not needed to obtain liberty. Frankly, these instances are unusual
        exceptions to the rule. Violence runs deep within the human psyche if it was wholly unnecessary and unnatural
        then why would humanity have retained the ability to be violent?</p>
      <p>To find the answer and also simultaneously allow our depiction of violence to evolve we can turn to Hannah
        Arendt. While a person like Fanon would see violence as a necessary display of force and power, Arendt sees
        violence as acting in opposition to power rather than being in alignment with it. For Arendt, it is simple;
        violence is simply a farce to make up for a lack of any real power. You can think of this in terms of the
        following situation, consider that you happen to be in a bar one night and things get tense between you and some
        show off in the corner. The show off decides to fight you with his muscles but you are only equipped with a
        simple handgun, you’ll more likely than not be the victor in that encounter - assuming you know how to properly
        handle your weapon. Your usage of the handgun made up for the lack of strength you had because you knew your
        noodle arms wouldn’t protect you. Violence elicits feelings of fear and obedience out of those who bear witness
        to it, any legitimate cause or purpose you stood for or held high lost its merits the moment violence entered
        into the frame. Arendt herself puts it best when she says “Violence can always destroy power; out of the barrel
        of a gun grows the most effective command, resulting in the most instant and perfect obedience. What never can
        grow out of it is power” (<i>On Violence</i>, Arendt). Exceptions to rules do exist and it is from Arendt that
        we are
        able to arrive at the most plausible answer for the previously asked question regarding humanity’s retention of
        violence and it is through the need to defend ourselves. On this matter Arendt says "In this sense,
        'self-defense' is a reason for violence; but this reason is valid only for those who are capable of using
        violence effectively” (Arendt). Whether it was against predators when humanity was in its infancy
        or against one another we retain the means to be violent as a means to survive.</p>
      <p>It would seem, to many at least, that the situation which prompted Fanon to write his piece would qualify as an
        effective use of violence even if it wasn’t in self defense, and beyond that both Arendt and Fanon seem to only
        focus on physical altercations but what about others. Fanon describing violence as an equivalence to power and
        Arendt describing violence as antithetical to power, how do we reconcile these opposing viewpoints and adapt
        them to the 21st century? Is there any purpose in doing this or should present-day philosophers start from the
        ground up?</p>
      <p>There are relatively few ideas that are wholly original and are instead innovations built upon other ideas, so
        it wouldn’t be productive to start from scratch. Personally, I believe that Arendt’s views are more practical
        and expressive on the dynamic that exists. This doesn’t necessarily disqualify Fanon’s views either, that would
        depend on whether you would declare rebellion against an oppressive regime to be self defense, that discussion
        belongs in a work of its own as including it here would make this work lengthy and put it out of focus. A
        blanket statement like ‘violence begets violence’ is a slippery slope solely by the meaning of the statement
        itself. The moment a side uses violence and the other retaliates you will continue to push for more and more
        violent activity until one side comes out victorious and the ideals of the opposition are put on hold at best
        and vanquished at worst. A consequence of the 21st century is that physical altercations are not the only type
        of interaction that should be subjected to potentially being labeled as violent. Arendt and Fanon are not around
        to amend their words to fit the modern world but really they don’t have to. Both of their ideas are able to be
        properly extrapolated to fit the ever evolving world and truly it is best to read both in succession as the
        ideas of one cannot be fully understood without the other.</p>
