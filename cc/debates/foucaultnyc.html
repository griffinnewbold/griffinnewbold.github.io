      <h5>Preface & Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        Reading the perspective Foucault had on discipline and the transition from targetting the body to targetting the
        soul brought to my mind the failings
        of New York City in the same kind of efforts of being more restorative rather than retributive.

      <h2>Text</h2>
      <p>Michel Foucault begins his work <i>“Discipline and Punish”</i> with a description detailing the transformation
        of
        punishment from those that target the body - such as drawing and quartering - to punishments that target the
        soul. The main idea being that the benefits that old forms of punishment came with are no longer present and it
        is better to reform individuals by teaching discipline rather than harming or in the extreme cases killing the
        criminals. The earliest ideas of restorative justice can be found in Foucault’s work and a lot of places around
        the world are attempting to introduce some form of restorative justice in place of the current system which is
        often seen as retributive. New York City is one of the cities that is trying to replace its criminal justice,
        but the city’s approach has often come under scrutiny for having what many say is the complete opposite outcome
        that the city has intended. Both Foucault and The City of New York prefer a form of restorative justice to the
        alternative, but when it comes to actual criminal justice, whose approach is more solid in actually
        accomplishing its objective?</p>
      <p>Foucault’s work predates the criminal justice reforms of New York by almost half a century so it is important
        to understand how Foucault came to understand the modern form of the Western penal system and what it means to
        him. Foucault’s analysis focuses on the transition from punishment of the physical body to that of the soul.
        Taming the soul, and teaching it discipline being the most effective tool of reform for the person as a whole.
        Foucault draws on the procedures from the time of the Black Death as a means to illustrate how discipline is a
        more effective means than physical harm. The discussion centers on how under the threat of being punished,
        rather than actual punishment itself, the people in the quarantine complied with orders and learned obedience in
        a time of absolute pandemonium. Foucault concludes this discussion by asserting “it is the certainty of being
        punished and not the horrifying spectacle of public punishment that must discourage crime” (Foucault,
        <i>“Discipline and Punish”</i> , Part 3). He goes on further to discuss that there are institutions beyond just
        prison that invoke
        the teaching of discipline; with schools being the primary institution that teaches discipline to those who come
        through it. Preventive discipline is the key when discussing these other institutions, like schools, that expose
        the soul to discipline, it is there that people learn to be productive and that productivity can come from
        conformity as well. Foucault states that “The body of the disciplined man is docile and subjected, but also
        productive and never wholly subtracted by the power that controls it" (Foucault, <i>“Discipline and Punish”</i>
        , Part 3).
        The ideas expressed reflect the rise of liberalism throughout the 18th and 19th centuries as the advent of an
        individual oriented society warrants the advent of self discipline or in the event that is deemed to be lacking
        institutions that will instill discipline by whatever means they see fit. At its core, from Foucault's work,
        restorative justice would mean to restore the soul to a place of stability and rearm it with the disciplines
        needed to properly function in society.</p>
      <p>In New York, the efforts toward restorative justice have looked a bit different. For a lot of types of crimes,
        specifically misdemeanors and low level felonies, there is no cash bail allowed which would mean you would not
        have to sit in jail while awaiting their day in court. The idea being that people of lower incomes wouldn’t be
        discriminately held due to them being unable to afford bail while wealthier individuals would be able just bail
        themselves out. A noble goal taken to extreme lengths and often in contrast with wider state laws, most notably
        the ‘three strike’ law on the books in the state of New York. Along with these changes some felonies are also
        often knocked down to misdemeanors to avoid the person being a felon (this happens in a lot of places but often
        New York can take it to the extreme). The negatives are often very easy to spot with a system like this. Back in
        2021, a Columbia University student was murdered at the hands of a person who had 16 prior arrests and was out
        waiting for his court date due to another previously committed crime. A more recent example would be when
        migrants got involved with a brawl with police officers in Times Square and were released with no bail and
        proceeded to vacate the city. This has led many to consider the approach New York is taking to be one of ‘catch
        and release’ (<cite>New York's 'catch and release' policies fail to hold criminals accountable: police
          rep</cite>, Fox News, 2024) The only true way in which the actions of New York City align with anything
        described in Foucault’s work is with the idea of mass surveillance. Foucault describes the idea of the
        panopticon where prisoners would know that they are always being watched but not able to see where the person
        watching them was. This being a form of discipline as it psychologically messes with prisoners into not
        committing any bad acts due to always being watched. Combining the mass allotment of cameras that NYC has at its
        disposal along with the previous description of how crime is often handled makes a fair amount of law abiding
        citizens worried that the purpose the cameras serve is to intimidate them rather than those who are actually at
        risk of committing a crime.</p>
      <p>True restorative justice should aim to bring the individual back into a state of being capable of being
        released into society, marking the slate clean in the process. Like how Catholics treat the sacrament of
        confession. Discipline is a trait that is a prerequisite for proper functioning in human society and Foucault
        was correct in asserting that there are institutions, other than prisons, which have a goal of instilling
        discipline. These institutions are present in all stages of life and are meant, when executed properly, to get
        us ready to interact with the wider world. Simply not holding lots of criminals, especially those with a prior
        record, accountable does no one any favors and certainly doesn’t teach them discipline but rather that they can
        do it again and again with little to no repercussions. <i>“Discipline and Punish”</i> can be interpreted in many
        different ways but the core statement of the work which is the same among many of the interpretations is that
        the certainty of being punished needs to be the deterrent rather than the punishment itself. If you have no
        deterrent then you lose your leverage and in this case the City of New York is guilty having lost its leverage
        but it is never too late to get it back and to execute restorative justice the right way rather than effectively
        enacting retribution on citizens who committed no crimes.</p>
